# Telegram Overseer: User Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the Telegram Overseer user guide! This tool is designed for easy data collection and analysis from Telegram. It's user-friendly for non-programmers, providing insights through various commands.
Certainly! I'll update the "Setting Up the Environment" section of your Markdown document to include instructions on how to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`. Since there are two separate files for Linux and Windows, I'll include steps for both operating systems.

## Setting Up the Environment

### Installing Python
Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Using Virtual Environments
Virtual environments in Python are used to manage project-specific dependencies. Here's how to set one up:

1. Open the Command Prompt or Terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory (e.g., `cd path/to/your/project`).
3. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv myenv`.
4. Activate the environment:
   - On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`.
   - On Linux, use `source myenv/bin/activate`.

### Installing Dependencies
After setting up and activating the virtual environment, you need to install the project dependencies.

1. Ensure you are in the project directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located.
2. Depending on your operating system, run one of the following commands:
   - On Windows: `pip install -r requirements_windows.txt`
   - On Linux: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the necessary libraries and packages needed to run Telegram Overseer.

### Running the Script
To run the Telegram Overseer script:

1. Ensure you're in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated.
2. Execute the script using `python telegram_overseer.py`.

## Outputs and Database
The outputs generated by Telegram Overseer are saved in the same directory where the tool is cloned from Git. The data is stored in a SQLite database, which can be viewed and managed through DBeaver.

### Using DBeaver
DBeaver offers a graphical interface for database management. To use it:

1. Download DBeaver from [the DBeaver website](https://dbeaver.io/download/).
2. Install and open DBeaver.
3. To connect to the SQLite database:
   - Choose SQLite as the database.
   - Browse to the database file created by Telegram Overseer.
4. Now you can view and manage the database.
