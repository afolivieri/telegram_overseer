# Telegram Overseer: User Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the Telegram Overseer user guide! This tool is designed for easy data collection and analysis from Telegram. It's user-friendly for non-programmers, providing insights through various commands.
Certainly! I'll update the "Setting Up the Environment" section of your Markdown document to include instructions on how to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`. Since there are two separate files for Linux and Windows, I'll include steps for both operating systems.

### Setting Up a Telegram Developer Account and Obtaining API Credentials**

Before you start using Telegram Overseer, you need to set up a Telegram Developer account and obtain your API ID and API Hash. These credentials are essential for the tool to interact with Telegram’s API. Follow these steps to set up your account and get your credentials:

1. **Create a Telegram Developer Account**:
   - Visit [Telegram’s Developer Page](https://my.telegram.org).
   - Log in with your Telegram account. Ensure that the phone number you use here is the same as the one you intend to use with Telegram Overseer.

2. **Register a New Application**:
   - Once logged in, go to the 'API development tools' section.
   - Click on 'Create a new application'.
   - Fill in the required details such as the application name, short name, and URL (if any). The application name can be anything, such as "Telegram Overseer".

3. **Obtain API ID and API Hash**:
   - After registering your application, you will receive your unique `API ID` and `API Hash`.
   - Make a note of these credentials as they will be required to configure the Telegram Overseer tool.

4. **Configuring Telegram Overseer**:
   - Use the `set_api_id` and `set_api_hash` commands in Telegram Overseer to input your obtained API ID and API Hash.
   - This will allow the tool to access Telegram's API with your developer credentials.

It's important to keep your API ID and API Hash confidential. These credentials provide access to the Telegram API and should only be used with trusted applications.

## Setting Up the Environment

### Installing Python
Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Using Virtual Environments
Virtual environments in Python are used to manage project-specific dependencies. Here's how to set one up:

1. Open the Command Prompt or Terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory (e.g., `cd path/to/your/project`).
3. Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv myenv`.
4. Activate the environment:
   - On Windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`.
   - On Linux, use `source myenv/bin/activate`.

### Installing Dependencies
After setting up and activating the virtual environment, you need to install the project dependencies.

1. Ensure you are in the project directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located.
2. Depending on your operating system, run one of the following commands:
   - On Windows: `pip install -r requirements_windows.txt`
   - On Linux: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the necessary libraries and packages needed to run Telegram Overseer.

### Running the Script
To run the Telegram Overseer script:

1. Ensure you're in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated.
2. Execute the script using `python telegram_overseer.py`.

## Outputs and Database
The outputs generated by Telegram Overseer are saved in the same directory where the tool is cloned from Git. The data is stored in a SQLite database, which can be viewed and managed through DBeaver.

### Using DBeaver
DBeaver offers a graphical interface for database management. To use it:

1. Download DBeaver from [the DBeaver website](https://dbeaver.io/download/).
2. Install and open DBeaver.
3. To connect to the SQLite database:
   - Choose SQLite as the database.
   - Browse to the database file created by Telegram Overseer.
4. Now you can view and manage the database.
